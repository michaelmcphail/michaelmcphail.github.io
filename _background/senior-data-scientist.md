## Role Overview

As a Senior Research Officer for the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) I develop statistical and computational modelling approaches to generate products that inform the reduction and elimination of malaria.

## Key Projects

### Malaria Seasonality
- My first major project with MAP was to analyse and describe malaria seasonality in sub-Saharan Africa.
- Understanding seasonal signals is important for strategic malaria intervention planning as the seasonality of a location dictates the effectiveness of interventions and the appropriate application of these interventions. 
- A publication is forthcoming.

### Malaria Elimination in Vietnam
- Vietnam has nearly eliminated malaria. This means the appropriate strategies, and the products that can inform these strategies differ to higher endemic settings. 
- We incorporated (and extended) a range of existing modelling approaches---network models, point process models, and geosptatistical approaches---to generate bespoke, informative maps and insights to support Vietnam's National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology, and Entomology (NIMPE) quest to eliminate malaria entirely from Vietnam.
- TODO: add link to Vietnam project page
- The work was published in the *Lancet Regional Health: Western Pacific*, and can be found [HERE](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanwpc.2025.101545 'Malaria elimination in Vietnam').

### Model for Improved Housing
- I have recently been working on a model for improved housing in Africa. 
- Improved housing has been declared a human right and has important consequences for the standards of living for the occupants: reduced exposure to infectious disease, reduced mortality and morbity, better sociodemographic conditions, and fewer childhood (under 5 years old) deaths.
- The impact of improved housing is comparable to that of insecticide treated nets on the reduction in malaria (*cf* [Tusting *et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002234 'Housing improvements and malaria risk')). From a modelling perspective, understanding the prevalence of improved housing is vital for understanding malaria prevalence.

- A publication is forthcoming.

### Global Burden (GB) Pipeline
- My ongoing work with MAP includes supporting the GB estimate pipeline, one of MAP's core outputs that includes global malaria prevalence, incidence, and mortality estimates. 
- The GB model is a sophisticated modelling pipeline that incorporates hundreds of thousands of survey points, case-incidence data, sattelite observations, and bespoke-modelled products to produce pixel-level (5km by 5km) estimates of malaria. Modelling stages include data transformations, time-series models, geospatial-regression models, machine learning models, and spatial disaggregations; all of which our team must be familiar with to support the routine GB estimates.
