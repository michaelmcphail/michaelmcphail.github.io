## Role Overview
I completed my DPhil (PhD) in 2019 at the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford as part of the Industrially Focussed Mathematical Modelling (InFoMM) program. I was supervised by Prof. Ian Griffiths and Prof. Jim Oliver at Oxford, and Dr Ritchie Parker at Nestl√©. My project was titled *The Mathematical Modelling of Cereal Extrusion*, and involved using asymptotic and numerical methods to interogate the complicated multi-phase flow equations that govern extruded mixtures.
