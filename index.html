                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I want this website to highlight the wide range of problems I've worked on, or am currently working on. The general thread linking these problems is that they possess three characteristics I find deeply motivating.
                   (1) they are all real-world problems with measurable, real-world impact; (2) they can all be tackled using analytic methods (including maths, stats, computational methods etc.); and (3) they are all challenging. If such problems interest you, please explore my website.</p> 
                 <p> For more about me, see my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/background/index.html">Background</a> page. In brief, I'm currently working at the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) in Perth, Western Australia, using geospatial analysis and statistical methods to support decision making for malaria elimination. 
                    Prior to this I spent six years at the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford to first complete my DPhil (PhD) in Industrial Applied mathematics and then as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in mathematical geoscience.</p>
                <p>This is still in development and I'm still moving information from my old website to this one. If you wish to get in touch, please email me at <span>michael.mcphail</span><span style="display:none;">remove-this</span><span>@thekids.org.au</span>.</p>
