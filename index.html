                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a mathematician, currently working as a Senior Research Officer at the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) in Perth Western Australia. 
                    Prior to this I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Oxford working on mathematical models of ice-sheet dynamics. 
                    I also completed my DPhil (PhD) in Industrially Focussed Mathematical Modelling at the University of Oxford. 
                    Before moving to the UK I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics (honours) as part of the Advanced Science program at the University of Western Australia.</p>
                <p>I built this website to share my work and some of my interests. This is still in development and I'm still moving information from my old website to this one.
