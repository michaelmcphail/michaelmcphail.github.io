# Things to do

## Blog topics
### InSAR
- Base technology and my interest
- Data integration (multiple satellite technologies such as sentinel-2/NMDI)
- Data assimilation from sensors (ideas)
- Innovations

### Traffic
- Basic interest
- Illustration of a simple interactive plot (compiled) with network.
- Maybe an interactive travel time dashboard (click on two nodes...estimate travel time, next node becomes destination and shifts previous destination to orgin, or switch to dictate which one we're choosing)

### Data
- Data monetisation, management, importance, sharing, security, tradeoffs (access/use/...).
