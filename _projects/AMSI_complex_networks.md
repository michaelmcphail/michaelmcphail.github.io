## Project Overview

During the summer of 2013&mdash;2014 I studied the statistical properties of complex networks while on an Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute (AMSI) summer vacation scholarship. The goal of this project was to understand what makes real world complex networks special. We used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method---perturbing the edge structure of the network---to explore the space of complex networks with the same degree distribution as some real world networks.

## Further reading
- A brief blog post that was published just after the completion of the project can be found [HERE](https://rhed.amsi.org.au/statistical-properties-complex-networks/) (in hindsight it could have done with a quick proof read!).

## Technical Details

- **MATLAB** for simulation
- **Real Data** including (i) the neural network structure for *c.elegans* (biological), (ii) airports connected by flight-paths in the U.S. (technological), (iii) a high school community (social), and (iv) co-authorship in Network Science (social).
