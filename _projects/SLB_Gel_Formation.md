## Project Overview

This project was part of a three month mini-project I worked on for the Industrially Focussed Mathematical Modelling (InFoMM) Centre for Doctoral Training. For these three months we collaborated with Schlumberger Gould Research in Cambridge to model a novel manufacturing process they were interested in.

Schlumberger was interested in investigating a process for manufacturing small, hollow gel-sleeves (see Fig. 1). Through this process, gel "sleeves" are made by injecting a solution containing one of the reactants (say Reactant A) into the center of a flowing solution containing another reactant (say Reactant B). The resulting flow environment is a coaxial flow, where an annular flow encloses an axisymmetric flow (see Fig. 2). The diffusion of reactants across the interface allows a gelation reaction to take place, resulting in an evolving gel-layer between the co-flowing fluids.

We modelled this system to better understand how the apparatus configuration determines the final properties of the gel-sleeves. By considering a number of interesting limits we were able to obtain good, leading-order predictions for some useful properties of the gel (e.g. the gel-sleeve diameter, and the rate of gel-mass increase along the axis of flow).

We also used COMSOL, proprietary multi-physics software, to perform full numerical simluations to (i) verify our analytic approach and (ii) obtain greater insight into the flow regimes.
