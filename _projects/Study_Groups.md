## Overview

Throughout my time as a researcher in mathematics I have attended a number of Maths in Industry Study groups, where I was able to work on a wide range of technical problems bought in by different industrial partners. These project typically only last a week, and their aim is to provide an oppurtunity for applied mathematicians to weigh in on these real-world problems.

### Durham (UK) 2016 
*Understanding drivers of environmental chemical concentrations*--**Syngenta**

The goal of this project was to understand why commercial modeling software predicts two seperate peaks in chemical concentration for a single application. We demonstrated that this was to be expected with seasonal rainfall and evaporation.

Study group report not yet available.

### Bath (UK) 2017 
*Optimal design of inflatable hydroponic systems*--**Phytophonics**

We investigated the mechanics of Phytophonics's novel design for a hydroponic system, and subsequently optimized the design to support greater plant-mass.
 
**Optimising the Design of Polythene Hydroponics Beds**:
*A. Champneys, I. Hewitt, William T. Lee, A. Leida, M. Mcphail, E. Murphy, J. Ockendon, L. Parkin, L. Roberts.*

### Barreira (Portugal) 2017 
*Organisational strategies for reducing jams in marathons*--**Lap2go**

We constructed a model for runner density in marathons that accounts for: different release strategies, running abilities, and possible choke points in a course. We then used this model to optimize marathon starting strategy (for race coordinators) to minimize time lost.
 
[**Managing start waves for mass running events**](http://dspace.uevora.pt/rdpc/handle/10174/25349):
*A. Paula, S. Barbeiro, R. Barreira, L. Cavique, J. Correia, M. Cruz, R. Enguiça, N. Lopes, M. McPhail, J. Santos, P. Simões, F. Wechsung.*

### Dublin (Ireland) 2018
*Liquid wicking in hierachical microstructures*--**Analog Devices**

We modelled the deposition and spread of a droplet over a microstructured surface. Our goal was to structure the surface for optimal spreading/wicking rate.
 
[**Liquid Wicking in Hierarchical Microstructures**](https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/10397):
*L. &Ograve; N&agrave;raigh, C. Deverapu, J. Herterich, D. Flynn, M. McPhail, D. Lunz, J.Dewynne.*

### Cape Town (South Africa) 2019
*Sustainability of fish populations*--**Prof Phil Broadbridge**

We used models for fish population---consisting of partial differential equations---and determined criteria for stable populations. We also determined how sensitive these criteria are to different habitat geometry and carrying capacity.

Study group report not yet available; although, some of the authors went onto publish subsequent work.
