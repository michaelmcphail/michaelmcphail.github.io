I'm not a prolific writer, so I don't expect this blog to be updated much. This feed will mostly cover topics I've recently taken an interest in and want to memorialise.

## What to Expect


## Why I'm Blogging


## Getting Started

I'll be posting regularly, so stay tuned! You can also:

- Check out my [projects](/projects/)

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to sharing more with you soon!
